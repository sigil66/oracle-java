Oracle Java Package
=========

Because it's 2016 and apparently Oracle can't be bothered to produce proper Debian packages, or adopt sane licensing that would allow others to create/distribute them.

#### Instructions

*Setup Build System*
```
sudo apt-get install ruby wget java-package
```
*Build Package*
```
cd <path to project>
rake
```
